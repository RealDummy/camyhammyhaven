## Bonding

---

If you are looking for a companion for a solo piggy, we can set up a bonding appointment. Our volunteers have facilitated dozens of bondings over the years. We will suggest pigs that we think will be a good match based on sex, age, and temperament. Then we will oversee the pigsâ€™ meeting and remain by your side until we can decide whether the pigs make good companions.
