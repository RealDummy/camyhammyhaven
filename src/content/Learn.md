## Guinea Pig Cages

- When it comes to thinking about your guinea pigs’ cage, just follow a few simple guidelines:
- The bigger the cage, the happier the guinea pigs. 
- Guinea pigs enjoy being part of household activities — they especially love to hear kitchen sounds and will let you know its snack time.
- **Never put your guinea pig house outside!**

We use C&C cages made of wire grids with a separate solid base of corrugated plastic (coroplast). You can design and build your own cage, purchase one online, or buy a set up from us.


We recommend lining the cage with fleece bedding, though disposable paper bedding or soft hay can be used. To get your pigs all set up, you will also need:

- A water bottle or heavy water dish
- A small, heavy food bowl 
- Hiding places (“hideys”)
- Wooden toys or hideys for chewing
- A hayrack, hay bag, or a “kitchen” to keep hay in one area of the cage

Spot clean your cage every day. Once or twice a week, do a complete clean by changing the bedding and wiping down the coroplast with vinegar and water


## Guinea Pig Diet

Every day guinea pigs need:

- Fresh water.
- ⅛ cup of high-quality pellets, such as Oxbow or Selective.
- 1 cup of vegetables (Bell peppers are the best and can be fed daily.)
- **Unlimited** Timothy grass hay (or oat or orchard for picky pigs). Alfalfa hay is only fed to pregnant pigs, nursing moms and young pigs and babies.
- 1 tablet of vitamin C (essential, since guinea pigs can’t produce vitamin C).

Most pigs also love carrot tops, corn husks, and even dandelion greens from a pesticide-free lawn. Occasionally you can give guinea pigs a small piece of fruit as a treat.

## Guinea Pig Health

To keep your guinea pigs physically and mentally healthy, here are a few tips:


- They thrive on routine, so try to give them meals and treats at the same time each day. If you forget to feed them, they will certainly let you know.

- Unless they have long hair, they don’t need baths — they clean themselves (and it’s really cute!). Their nails, however, need to be trimmed about once a month. 

- They love the opportunity to free roam and stretch their legs outside of their cage. You can create a large, safe indoor play area or give them an entire room. Just make sure the area is pig-proofed beforehand (no electrical cords for them to chew on, low pieces of furniture under which they can get stuck, etc).

- Be warned that your pigs will poop … A LOT. The average pig produces 100 poops a day so don’t be alarmed if you see them all over the cage (but do spot clean).

- Most piggies enjoy being held and stroked by their hooman. Remember that no matter how much they love you, their prey instinct means they will resist being picked up out of their cage — so when they run away from you, don’t take it personally.

One thing: You should have a vet for your guinea pigs before you ever need one. If you notice any symptoms of illness, like  **weight or hair loss, excessive scratching, breathing difficulties, discharge from the eyes or nose, lumps, skin lesions, lethargy, diarrhea, or overgrown teeth,** take them to the vet. We also recommend yearly checkups for the little guys and gals.
