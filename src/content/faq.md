##### Why should I have a pair of pigs?

Guinea pigs are social animals and can get lonely and stressed out if they don’t have a companion. We call a pair of guinea pigs bonded partners.
  
##### How much space do guinea pigs need? 

Guinea pigs need space to run around and keep from getting bored. The minimum cage for a pair of pigs is 7.5 sq. ft. but with guinea pigs, more space is always better. 

##### Are guinea pigs friendly? 

Like people, each pig has a unique personality. Most enjoy being held and stroked by their human. Keep in mind that no matter how much they love you, their prey instinct means they will resist being picked up out of their cage — so when they run away from you, don’t take it personally!

##### What if I don’t know what to do once I get them home?

Just get in touch with us! We are always happy to help.

##### Can I “try them out” before I adopt?

Yes, we call that fostering! We can send you home with the pigs and their supplies. If it’s a match, just let us know and we can complete the adoption process.

##### How long do guinea pigs live?

The average life span is 5 to 7 years, but pigs can live longer. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the oldest pig lived to be 14! Guinea pigs require a (pig) lifetime commitment, but they can easily adapt to new homes and environments.

##### What’s the right age for my kids to get guinea pigs?

They are good pets for kids of all ages! Younger kids can safely stroke guinea pigs placed in cuddle cups or fleece bags, while older kids also can help care for them. As the adult, however, you have the responsibility for their care and safety.

##### Do guinea pigs bite?

They don’t bite but they may nibble. Some guinea pigs will nip to let you know they want to return to their cage. 

##### Where should I keep my guinea pig enclosure?

Guinea pigs are social animals and love to be near household activities so they can regularly interact with their humans. (They really, really love to hear sounds from the kitchen and will soon start wheeling for food!)  Guinea pigs *should not* live outdoors or in isolated rooms of the house.

##### Can I have a guinea pig if I have other pets?

Yes! If you have animals with a strong prey drive, you will need to keep the pigs separate for them, at least until you are confident they all get along. Separation can be as simple as placing the guinea pigs’ enclosure on a high table, setting up gates, or having a top on your cage. There are many instances of guinea pigs becoming friends with bunnies, dogs, and even cats.

##### Do guinea pigs need to see the vet? 

We recommend a checkup every year with an “exotics” vet. You will want to contact a vet immediately if your pigs stop eating or pooping. Ask us for recommendations for good clinics in the Bay Area.
